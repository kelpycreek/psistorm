Hi!

This is an interactive charactersheet that allows users to easily select abilities and weapons for their psistorm characters.

Psistorm is an rpg that uses a hidden tech tree. Player's dont know what abilities are available to them, and instead pick
from a limited selection each time they level up.
Selecting an ability might unlock more powerful abilities, but players will have to play the game many times to learn how
the entire tree works.

Players play as psychic assassins employed to do the bidding of a morally corrupt organization.


From a technical perspective:
* The frontend uses react to update the character sheet in response to changing state.
* Google's firebase api keeps track of realtime changes on the database side to monitor updates made to the character by the dm
